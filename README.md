### Hello World!

My name is Brendan. 

> _“Brand lives in the mind of the customer. It is created instantly and also over time. It is hard to build and easy to destroy. Done correctly, brand can create a moment when company and customer walk in perfect step.”_ -Anonymous

We live in a Digital Age surrounded by a plethora of social media platforms that define one's brand.  In the past, an individual would need to work to build a brand; unlike today, where one's brand is quickly created by their Digital footprint.  Welcome to one of my many footprints.
